## 🏗️ Development Details

The project follows the MVC model, leveraging the Inertia framework to seamlessly integrate Laravel and Vue.js. The login system was implemented using Laravel Breeze, providing a smooth user experience.

## 📚 My learning Journey

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to explore new concepts and technologies:

📌 E-mail notifications and mail-trapping for seamless user communication.

📌 Back-end events and event listeners to handle various interactions.

📌 Middlewares to enhance the application's security and control flow.

📌 Leveraging Tailwind CSS to craft a stunning and responsive UI.
